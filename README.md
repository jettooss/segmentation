## segmentation satellite images

## Author:Jettooss(Утляков Андрей )



This neural network is segmentation of 14 classes .I took the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaroslavnaychuk/satelliteimagesegmentation
 
I was offered to do this project at the FESTO computing center in order to write a scientific article.

## What is the purpose of the project ?
The main goal of the project was to segmentation natural fields in order to determine if the field is abandoned, which plants are growing.This is necessary for the state to track farmers from satellite images
Transferring the model to qgis so that the user can segmentation himself , and then enter it into the database.
Implement the definition of NDVI and EVI fields

QGIS (Quantum GIS) is a free and open-source geographic information system (GIS) software that allows you to create, edit, visualize, and analyze spatial data. It is used by individuals, organizations, and government agencies around the world for a variety of purposes, such as mapping, land use planning, natural resource management, environmental analysis, and urban planning. QGIS is cross-platform and works on Windows, macOS, Linux, as well as on mobile devices.


## Problems I have encountered
Technical problems.I was limited only by the free colab, the maximum prediction is 60 %
## The project will still be finalized, many more have not been implemented.
 So far, only images from datasets are segmented
