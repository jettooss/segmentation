## Author:Jettooss(Утляков Андрей )



This neural network is segmentation of 14 classes .I took the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaroslavnaychuk/satelliteimagesegmentation
 
I was offered to do this project at the FESTO computing center in order to write a scientific article.

## What is the purpose of the project ?
-The main goal of the project was to segmentation natural fields in order to determine if the field is abandoned, which plants are growing
-Transferring the model to qgis so that the user can segmentation himself , and then enter it into the database.
QGIS (Quantum GIS) is a free and open-source geographic information system (GIS) software that allows you to create, edit, visualize, and analyze spatial data. It is used by individuals, organizations, and government agencies around the world for a variety of purposes, such as mapping, land use planning, natural resource management, environmental analysis, and urban planning. QGIS is cross-platform and works on Windows, macOS, Linux, as well as on mobile devices.


## Problems I have encountered
-Technical problems.I was limited only by the free colab, the maximum prediction is 60 %
